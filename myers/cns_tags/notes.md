I did not struggle to think of changes, but it was hard to craft the right commands for the llm to follow the instructions. I am satisfied with the results. They are a huge step up from the story's original tags, with each relating to the story written about Holliday, and allowing the story to reach a wider audience. This was somewhat repetive, because my tweaks to the command were slight, with most of the script remaining the same. I think a better workflow would be less regimented and more open. In a perfect world, I could submit commands independent of each other, with the llm not needing the text link repeated in every message. Despite this, I found the task to be easy enough.
