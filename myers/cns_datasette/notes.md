CNS Datasette Analysis - October 1, 2025

- What was the most interesting thing you saw doing this?
I was most interested by the depth of content the datasette stored. Also the ease with which it processed the commands once the datasette had been fully uploaded.
- What was the most useful thing you saw doing this?
The most useful thing I saw was the commands to run logs and paths to see recent inputs and history with the llms.
- How useful was Datasette for this kind of analysis?
Datasette was very useful because it neatly arranged large amounts of data and had a lot of filters and ways to sift through and find stories, topics, embeddings, and more filters. 
- What would you use this tool for in a newsroom?
I think this tool would assist a newsroom in going through and looking for trends they wouldn't notice without the ability to put all of its articles in one data pool. Using the various filters, a newsroom could identify a story trend they hadn't seen prior by grouping together topics, embeddings, and more to find common threads.
- How does this compare to analyzing data in other tools?
I think this tool works best for larger data sets. If it were smaller, I think you would be able to get by with a less comprehrensive tool, but for the data used today and this semester, datasette is a strong tool.
