CNS Embeddings - 9/24/25

This is a very interesting and useful tool to see the vast variety of content CNS has in its archive. When going through individual stories, it is clear how the bunching together works. Stories that share the same key points and subjects are placed near each other, and other stories that share similar elements while also covering different topics are close, but not right on top. The further away the clumps are, the less similar the key words/topics are. This visualization definitely helps me understand CNS coverage and the different subjects they report on. One thing that comes to mind to improve the visualization would be to have topic names generated for the larger clumps when you are zoomed out, so that the user does not need to hover over individual stories to know what subject they are exploring. I think that would help the user know where to look specifically rather than hovering over a bunch of different stories across different clumps to find the subject they are looking for.
